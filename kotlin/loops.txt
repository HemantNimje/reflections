LOOPS:
	FOR:
		the for loop can be used to repeat any task multiple times such as printing 1 to 10 can be done as
			e.g. for(i in 1..10){
					println(i)
				}

		we can use for loop to print the elements of an array as
			e.g. var array = arrayOf("Java","Kotlin","Python")
				 for(elements in array){
				 println(elements)
				 }

		here "i" or "elements" represents one element at a time from t

		Lets have a bonus code just for fun
			e.g.
				for((index,value) in array.withIndex()){
					println("The element at $index is $value")
				}

			this code will give output as
				The element at 0 is Java
				The element at 1 is Kotlin
				The element at 2 is Python
