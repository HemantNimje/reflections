Classes in kotlin is same as the one in java, just a better way to do it.
Now in kotlin the syntax for classes is a bit different than java yet simple enough to learn.
e.g.
	
class Person{
    var name: String = "Sarah"
    var age: Int = 25
}

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    var person = Person()
    println(person.name)
    println(person.age)

    person.name = "max"
    person.age = 22

    println(person.name)
    println(person.age)
}


the output for the above code will be:
	Sarah
	25
	max
	22
