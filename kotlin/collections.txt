COLLECTIONS:

We can use list,array,arrayList as our collections

Array - to be used when the elements are fixed and are not going to change over time
	e.g. array of states (fixed size)

List - to be used when the elements are to be added or to be removed over time
	e.g. list of players in a match (the players will be changed over time)
	Yet the list is immutable list. We can rather create a mutable list using ArrayList

ArrayList - to be used when need to create a mutable list

	ARRAY:
		We can simply create an array with all elements as same datatype or different datatype as 
			val numbers = intArrayOf(1,2,3,4,5)	- all elements of same datatype
			val mixed = arrayOf("Hello",17,3.0,false) - all elements of different datatype

		Array addition is allowed for arrays of same datatype
			val primaryStates = arrayOf("Pennsylvania","Ohio","Virginia")
			val secondaryStates = arrayOf("California","Texas")
			val allStates = primaryStates + secondaryStates

You can add the new members to the arraylist by using .add method and include the argument in parenthesis.

In addition to this you can add any element at any specific location by using its index
	e.g. 	val arrayList = new arrayListOf("One","Two","Three")
			arrayList.add(0,"Zero")

	If you print this arraylist using
		println(arrayList)
	it will print the arraylist as
		[Zero,One,Two,Three]
