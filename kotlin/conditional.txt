CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS:
	You can either use if statements or when statements to use conditional approach
	e.g.
		if(age < 21){
			doSomething
		}

		val mode: Int = 3
		when(mode){
			1 -> doSomething
			2 -> {
				doSomthingElse
			}
			3 -> doSomethingDifferent
			else -> {
				doSomethingForRestOfTheCases
			}
		}

NOTE : when is similiar to switch statement in Java provided that we don't need to declare break after each case in kotlin as break is implicit in kotlin

CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS: 
	For these you have to return the result in any value like
		val mode: Int = 3
		val result = when(mode){
			1 -> "One"
			2 -> {
				"Two"
			}
			3 -> "Three"
			else -> {
				"Not one two or three"
			}

			println(result)
		}
