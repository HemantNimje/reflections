Steps to create a preference screen

1. Create Activity for Settings

1.1 Create a new Activity called SettingsActivity
1.2 Create a new resource folder called menu
1.3 Create visualizer_menu.xml in menu and add a menu item in it
1.4 Add the menu to the menu bar
1.5 Handle "Settings" menu item click to open SettingsActivity
	1.5.1 Navigate to Settings activity
		1.5.1.1 override OnOptionsItemSelected
		1.5.1.2 get the id, check if it matches the id for settings and if does then create explicit intent to create the settingsActivity. 
		1.5.1.3 Make the settingsActivity as child activity of main activity by defining the parentActivityName for the SettingsActivity
		1.5.1.4 Declare MainActivity launchMode as singleTop to make sure that when you redirect back from SettingsActivity it do not remake the main activity.
	1.5.2 Navigate back to the parent activity
		1.5.2.1 Inside the SettingsActivity find the actionBar and setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled.
		1.5.2.2 Override the onOptionsItemSelected to find the itemId for home. If matches use NavUtis.navigateUpFromSameTask to navigate back to the parent activity.
