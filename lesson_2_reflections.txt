1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Whenever you initialize a repository a new repository will be created. All the content inside the repository folder is pushed to the git. 
By creating a new repository for a project we can commit the changes during the development process to perform version-control.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working directory is the directory where your files for the current project/task resides and your current changes are in current directory before commit.

The staging area lets you choose the file before you make a commit.
In this you can add one or more files at a time.
The files put in the staging area are ready for the commit but not put on the git until commit is made.
Using git add you can push your file to the staging area.

Repository is for the git, where you can commit your files which further will be useful for version-control.
Once you commit the changes using git commit the changes are pushed to the git repository

git diff : to find the difference between a file at working directory and staging area
git diff --staged : to find the difference between a file at staging area and repository

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

For each logical change we can push the changes to the staging area and then we can make the final commit to push the changes to the respository.
