1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Whenever you initialize a repository a new repository will be created. All the content inside the repository folder is pushed to the git. 
By creating a new repository for a project we can commit the changes during the development process to perform version-control.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area lets you choose the file before you make a commit.
In this you can add one or more files at a time.
The files put in the staging area are ready for the commit but not put on the git until commit is made.

Working directory is the directory where your files for the current project/task resides.

Repository is for the git, where you can commit your files which further will be useful for version-control.
